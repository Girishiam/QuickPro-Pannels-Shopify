        "quote_text": "<p>Whether you are on the go to a rodeo, jackpot, trail ride, camping, or even need a temporary fence or stall at home, QuickPro Panels are your solution for quick, easy stalls or fencing. I have been involved in rodeo my entire life, being the footsteps of a fourth generation in my family to do so. I have traveled to rodeos all over and having panels has been a lifesaver at times when there are no stalls, they are very small or not safe, or to lessen the risk of contracting illnesses while being in barns with other horses. I am extremely picky where I keep my horses and have one that has escaped from my old panels, but has been unable to escape out of QuickPro Panels. I invented these for quick, functioning convenience & have a patent pending. QuickPro Panels take less panels to provide more stall area.</p>",
